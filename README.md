# 🌌 Hubble JWT Log Analyzer 🚀

Welcome to the *Hubble JWT Log Analyzer* project! Just like the Hubble Space Telescope explores the mysteries of the cosmos, this project aims to unravel the secrets hidden in your logs with a twinkle of machine learning magic! 🌟

## Overview 🌠

The Hubble JWT Log Analyzer is all about analyzing logs securely and efficiently. By channeling logs through a secure connection 🛡️, we process them through a state-of-the-art machine learning model. This model is like our own Hubble – it periodically trains itself to become smarter and returns stellar insights, which are then consumed by the ELK stack for further exploration and visualization. 📊

## Core Functionality ⚙️

- **Secure Log Transmission**: Using JWT for secure log transfer, ensuring that your data remains as safe as the secrets of the universe. 🔒
- **Intermittent Model Training**: Our machine learning model trains intermittently, always improving, always learning. Just like Hubble's never-ending quest for knowledge! 🧠
- **Insights Generation**: Transforming raw logs into actionable insights, ready to be consumed by the ELK stack. 🌐
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: All model operations are orchestrated by a robust Kubernetes cluster, ensuring smooth sailing across the data galaxy. 🌌
